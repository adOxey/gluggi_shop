Big issues:
  ✔ Fix problem with refreshing page and rerendering navigation bar. @done(20-06-11 22:59)
  While waiting to check if user is logged in navigation bar is for a moment rendered as if user is not logged in. 
  When i receive response from Firestore with info that user is logged in, only then navigation is correcty rendered with protected routes.
  Posible solution (check async nature of the API call or if needed prepare spinner or sceleton UI)
  // Fixed with a simple if/else statement - show navigation only if user information is fetched from firebase.
  ☐ Decide what to do with Local Storage.
  Easy way / Just get rid of it for a sake of Firebase
  Hard way / Find a way to implement better with Firestore.
