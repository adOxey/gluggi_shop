Big issues:
  ✔ Fix problem with refreshing page and rerendering navigation bar. @done(20-06-11 22:59)
      While im waiting to check if user is logged in navigation is rendered as if user is not logged in for a brief moment. 
      When i receive async response from Firestore with information that user is logged in, only then navigation is correcty rendered with protected routes.
      Posible solutions (check async nature of the API call or if needed prepare spinner or sceleton UI)
  ☐ Local Storage doesn`t remember quantity.
      When user change quantity of product in cart and then refresh page, product is still there but quantity is reseted to 1.
  ✔ Implement "Delete" function for products. @done(20-06-09 19:36)
  ☐ Implement "Edit" function for products.
  ✔ Enable Firebase Storage and implement Image upload in Add Product form. @done(20-06-14 13:50)
  ☐ Enable realtime datebase. When products is added i want to have that product rendered on page without need to refresh products page which is case now.
  ✔ Implement fully functional Search component @done(20-06-12 16:15)
  ☐ Search queries needs debounde function to be optimal. Now is clunky.
  ✔ Implement fully functional Reviews @done(20-07-06 23:42)
  ☐ Need to do integration od Stripe package to Checkout component.
  ✔ Split users and admins via Firebase Admin SDK and grant them diferent set of rights. @done(20-07-06 21:39)
      I will probably need to use Firebase functions or some kinda of server for Firebase Admin SDK. 
      I should never be in the front end part of app.
  ✔ Make Modal UI component responsive on mobile devices. @done(20-07-01 19:54)
   ☐ Add sceleton UI or spinner for featured reviews component.
